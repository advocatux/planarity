Planarity
=========

Planarity is a game of untangling.  Rearrange the vertices so that no
two edges intersect.  The vertices and edges form a planar graph, so
this is guaranteed to be possible.  It may not be easy, though.

Planarity was written for Ubuntu Touch.  It is a pure-QML application,
so it should run easily on any platform that supports QML.  Launch it
using the desktop file or with `qmlscene ui/Main.qml`.
